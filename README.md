# CS61CPU

Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:

One bug we encountered was having incompatible widths. We fixed this by using bit extenders and we learned that bit extenders can work in either direction.
I really enjoyed working on task 6. While it was very tedius to fill to complete the control logic (and we had to use a lot of copy paste) I found that the repetion allowed me to far better understand the concepts.
I think a fix for a future semester would involve making part A slightly longer and part B slightly shorter (instead of having A be worth 20% and be be worth 80%). This would alleviate student stress while still being the same net amount of work
